      <p><strong>Violations</strong><br>
        Violations of these Acceptable Use Policies should be referred to contact@codetry.org. 
        All complaints will be investigated promptly. Failure to follow any term 
        or condition will be grounds for immediate account deactivation. </p>
      <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br>
        Codetry cannot be held liable for system down time, crashes or 
        data loss. We cannot be held liable for any predicated estimate of profits 
        which a client would have gained if their site was functioning. Certain 
        services provided by Codetry are resold. Thus, certain equipment, 
        routing, software and programming used by Codetry are not directly 
        owned or written by Codetry. Moreover, Codetry holds no 
        responsibility for the use of our clients' accounts. Failure to comply 
        with any terms or conditions will result in the automatic deactivation 
        of the account in question. We reserve the right to remove any account, 
        without advance notice for any reason without restitution, as Codetry 
        sees fit. </p>
      <p><strong>Account Activation</strong><br>
        By activating your account with Codetry, you agree to the above 
        policies and disclaimer. Upon requesting activation of an account, you 
        are required to accept these policies, guidelines and disclaimer, and 
        a copy of your acceptance is forwarded along with your activation request 
        to be maintained with your account information. </p>
      <p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> If you sign up for an account and fail to comply 
        with these terms, no refunds will be given. We will, however, advise you 
        by e-mail or phone prior to taking any action to provide you with an opportunity 
        to correct the problem. </p>
      <p><strong>Server Uptime Guarantee</strong><br>
        Although Codetry has an excellent record for reliability, we do not offer an uptime guarantee. However, our network and servers are monitored continuously, and are rarely down except for scheduled maintenance and hardware and software upgrades. </p>
      <p>Codetry reserves the right to amend any or all of the above policies, 
        guidelines and disclaimer without notification. We also retain the right 
        to increase any pricing and make changes to our account plans without 
        notification.<br>
        <br>
 
        <br>
        As a provider of web site hosting and other Internet-related services, 
        Codetry offers its customer (also known as &quot;Subscribers&quot;) 
        and their customers and users the means to acquire and disseminate a wealth 
        of public, private, commercial and non-commercial information. Codetry 
        respects that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion 
        and dissemination of information. However, when there are competing interests 
        at issue, Codetry reserves the right to take certain preventive 
        or corrective actions. In order to protect these competing interests, 
        Codetry has developed an <strong>Acceptable Use Policy (&quot;AUP&quot;)</strong>, 
        which supplements and explains certain terms of each customer's respective 
        service agreement, and is intended as a guide to the customer's rights 
        and obligations when using Codetry' services. This AUP will be revised 
        from time to time. </p>
      <p>One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party owns or controls 
        it. This fact accounts for much of the Internet's openness and value, 
        but it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of 
        those who use it, both in the information they acquire and in the information 
        they disseminate to others. When subscribers obtain information through 
        the Internet, they must keep in mind that Codetry cannot monitor, 
        verify, warrant or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information 
        they acquire. For this reason, the subscriber must exercise his or her 
        best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Internet, and 
        also should be aware that some material posted to the Internet may be 
        sexually explicit or otherwise offensive. Because Codetry cannot 
        monitor or censor the Internet, and will not attempt to do so, Codetry 
        cannot accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers resulting 
        from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive or illegal Internet communications. 
      </p>
      <p>When subscribers disseminate information from the Internet, they must 
        keep in mind that Codetry does not review, edit, censor or take 
        responsibility for any information its subscribers may create. When users 
        place information on the Internet, they have the same liability as other 
        authors for copyright infringement, defamation and other harmful speech. 
        Also, because the information created is carried over Codetry' 
        network and may reach a large number of people, including both subscribers 
        and non-subscribers of Codetry, subscribers' postings to the Internet 
        may affect other subscribers and may affect Codetry' goodwill, 
        business, reputation or operations. For these reasons, subscribers violate 
        Codetry policy and the Service Agreement when they, their customers, 
        affiliates or subsidiaries engage in the following prohibited activities: 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Spamming:</strong> <br>
        Sending unsolicited bulk and/or commercial information over the Internet. 
        It is not only harmful because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes 
        toward Codetry, but also because it can overload Codetry' 
        network and disrupt service to Codetry' subscribers. Also, 
        maintaining an open SMTP relay is prohibited. When a complaint is received, 
        Codetry will investigate and shutdown the account that is 
        SPAMing. A $250 charge for violating this policy will be charged to the 
        person initiating the SPAM. Furthermore Codetry reserves 
        the right to prosecute for this violation. A $1.00 charge will be assessed 
        PER EMAIL sent should Codetry choose to pursue and prosecute. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Audio/Video Streaming</strong>: <br>
        Audio/Video Streaming is not hosting friendly. As such, Codetry 
        does not allow any streaming of audio or video content. Offending accounts 
        will be suspended without noticed or terminated. </p>
      <p><strong>Adult-Oriented Content: </strong><br>
        Codetry does not allow adult content and will suspend/terminate 
        any offending account.</p>
      <p><strong>Large File Policy: </strong><br>
        Codetry is not for file hosting and distribution - as such, 
        customers may not host any files larger than 50MB in size that are observed 
        to be available for the sole purpose of download. Such files include but 
        are not limited to .ISO, audio/video files, .EXE files. If you are unsure 
        whether your file is against this policy, please e-mail contact@codetry.org. </p>
      <p><strong>Obscene Speech or Materials:</strong> <br>
        Using Codetry' network to advertise, transmit, store, post, display, 
        or otherwise make available child pornography or obscene speech or material 
        is prohibited. Codetry is required by law to notify law enforcement 
        agencies when it becomes aware of the presence of child pornography on 
        or being transmitted through its network. </p>
      <p><strong>Defamatory or Abusive Language:</strong> <br>
        Using Codetry' network as a means to transmit or post negative, 
        defamatory, harassing, abusive or threatening language. </p>
      <p><strong>Forging of Headers:<br>
        </strong>Forging or misrepresenting message headers, whether in whole 
        or in part, to mask the originator of the message. </p>
      <p><strong>Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks: 
        </strong><br>
        Accessing, illegally or without authorization, computers, accounts or 
        networks belonging to another party, or attempting to penetrate security 
        measures of another individual's system (often known as &quot;hacking&quot;). 
        Also, any activity that may be used as a precursor to an attempted system 
        penetration (i.e., port scan, stealth scan or other information-gathering 
        activity). </p>
      <p><strong>Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses or Other 
        Destructive Activities</strong>: <br>
        Distributing information regarding the creation of and sending Internet 
        viruses, worms, Trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mail bombing or denial 
        of service attacks. Also, activities that disrupt the use of or interfere 
        with the ability of others to effectively use the network or any connected 
        network, system, service or equipment. </p>
      <p><strong>Facilitation a Violation of this AUP:</strong> <br>
        Advertising, transmitting or otherwise making available any software, 
        program, product or service that is designed to violate this AUP, which 
        includes the facilitation of the means to spam, initiation of pinging, 
        flooding, mail bombing, denial of service attacks and piracy of software. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Export Control Violations:</strong> <br>
        Exporting encryption software over the Internet or otherwise, to points 
        outside the United States. </p>
      <p><strong>Usenet Groups:</strong> <br>
        Codetry reserves the right not to accept postings from newsgroups 
        where we have actual knowledge that the content of the newsgroup violates 
        the AUP. </p>
      <p><strong>Other Illegal Activities: </strong><br>
        Engaging in activities that are determined to be illegal, including, but 
        not limited to, advertising, transmitting or otherwise making available 
        ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, fraudulently charging credit cards and 
        pirating software. </p>
      <p><strong>Other Activities: </strong><br>
        Engaging in activities, whether lawful or unlawful, that Codetry 
        determines to be harmful to its subscribers, operations, reputation, goodwill 
        or customer relations. </p>
      <p>As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding harmful activities 
        just described rests primarily with the subscriber. Codetry will 
        not, as an ordinary practice, monitor the communications of its subscribers 
        to ensure that the comply with Codetry' policy or applicable law. 
        However, when Codetry becomes aware of harmful activities, it may 
        take any action to stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited 
        to, removal of information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening 
        software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to 
        the Internet, or any other action deemed appropriate by Codetry. 
      </p>
      <p>Codetry is also aware that many of its subscribers are themselves 
        providers of Internet services, and that information reaching Codetry' 
        facilities from those subscribers may have originated from a customer 
        of the subscriber or from another third party. Codetry does not 
        require its subscribers who offer Internet services to monitor or censor 
        transmissions or web sites created by customers of its subscribers. Codetry 
        reserves the right to directly take action against a customer of its subscribers. 
        Also, Codetry may take action against the Codetry' subscriber 
        because of activities of a customer of the subscriber, even though the 
        action may affect other customers of the subscriber. Similarly, Codetry 
        anticipates that subscribers who offer Internet services will cooperate 
        with Codetry in any corrective or preventive action that Codetry 
        deems necessary. Failure to cooperate with such corrective or preventive 
        measures is a violation of Codetry policy. </p>
      <p>Codetry will not intentionally monitor private electronic mail 
        messages sent or receive by its subscribers, unless required to do so 
        by law, governmental authority or when public safety is at stake. Codetry 
        may, however, monitor its service electronically to determine that its 
        facilities are operating satisfactorily. Also, Codetry may disclose 
        information, including, but not limited to, information concerning a subscriber, 
        a transmission made using our network, or a web site, in order to comply 
        with a court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute, 
        regulation or governmental request. Codetry assumes not obligation 
        to inform the subscriber that subscriber information has been provided 
        and, in some cases, may be prohibited by law from giving such notice. 
        Finally, Codetry may disclose subscriber information or information 
        transmitted over its network where necessary to protect Codetry 
        and others from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary to the proper 
        operation of the system. However, Codetry will never sell information 
        to other services or outside companies. </p>
      <p>Codetry expects that its subscribers who provide Internet services 
        to others will comply fully with all applicable laws concerning the privacy 
        of online communications. A subscriber's failure to comply with those 
        laws will violate Codetry policy. Finally, Codetry wishes 
        to emphasize that, in signing the Service Agreement, subscribers indemnify 
        Codetry for any violation of the Service Agreement, law or Codetry 
        policy resulting in loss to Codetry or the bringing of any claim 
        against Codetry by any third party. This means that, if Codetry 
        is sued because of a subscriber's or customer of a subscriber's activity, 
        the subscriber will be responsible for payment of any damages awarded 
        against Codetry, plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
      <p>We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying the obligations of Internet 
        users, including Codetry and its subscribers, as responsible 
        members of the Internet. Any complaints about a subscriber's violation 
        of this AUP should be sent to contact@codetry.org.<br>
